<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<hr/>
Using <code>\{{#hl}}</code> helper with no lang

{{#hl}}
<button>Click me</button>
{{/hl}}

Using <code>\{{#hl lang='html'}}</code> to highlight

{{#hl lang='html'}}
<button>Click me</button>
{{/hl}}

<hr/>

{{#md}}

##Highlighting an external file from base

This will pull in an external file using your base to resolve the path. In this example,
`button.html` lives in the `_includes` directory

{{/md}}

Code: <code>\{{hl src='button.html'}}</code>

{{hl src='button.html'}}

{{#md}}
##Highlighting an external file relative to base

All files includes are relative to the base setting, regardless of the current file you are working in.

In addition, paths that begin with a dot `.` will be resolved before looking in includes directories
etc. So, in this example if I wanted to include the contents of the `.gitignore`
and the **base** is set to `test/fixtures`, all I need do is:

{{/md}}

<code>\{{hl src='../../.gitignore'}}</code>

{{hl src='../../.gitignore'}}
