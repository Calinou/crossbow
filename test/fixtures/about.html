##Crossbow - easy to use, with killer features.

###Features:

* **Lighting fast compilation.** Crossbow is so fast as building your site,
you can do it on file change for an ultra-fast workflow.
* **Powerful out of the box.** With ZERO configuration, Crossbow is already
superior to your current static generator.
* **Extendible.** Go even further with custom helpers and full control, only if needed.
* **Pretty Markup.** Where other tools fail, Crossbow excells. We believe beautiful markup
is a valuable feature for development, helping you spot bugs and generally just looking
exactly how you want it to.
* **Pretty URLs.** With a single option, get rid of those `.html` extensions for good.
* **Ready to deploy.** Work in a `_src` directory, build to root, push to github.
